Title: Echo Pixels

Concept:
I plan to build an interactive p5.js experience that turns a live webcam feed into a pixelated visual, and interact with real-time microphone input.
At rest, the screen appears pixelated and still, As ambient sound volume increases, pixel colors begin to shift, shimmer, or brighten.

I chose to build this project because I was interested in creating a non-invasive, ambient interaction — one where people didn’t have to click or touch, but could still influence the environment.
Using sound as the only input, the experience becomes almost meditative: you can sit silently and watch the scene remain still, or you can speak, laugh, or let music play and watch the canvas respond.
The pixelated visuals represent a blurred memory or frozen moment, and sound acts as the emotional force that brings life into the stillness.

resouces:
p5.sound library: https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound

interaction:
speaking, clapping, or making noise

progress:
Built a pixelation version of the camera feed

question:
not sure the shape of pixels
do I need to add other interaction
