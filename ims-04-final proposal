Title: Echo Pixels

Concept:
I will build an interactive p5.js experience that turns a live webcam feed into a pixelated visual, and interact with real-time microphone input.
At rest, the screen appears pixelated and still, As ambient sound volume increases, pixel colors begin to shift, shimmer, or brighten.

resouces:
p5.sound library: https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound

interaction:
speaking, clapping, or making noise

progress:
Built a pixelation version of the camera feed
